# AZ Government Covid Site Redesign
## Jason Lai DH110 Fall 2021
### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
My project is a redesign of the Arizona Government's COVID-19 resource page. Especially during the pandemic, access to Covid-19 resources is essential. I hope that my redesign is able to push the current website in a more desirable and usable direction. 
### Clear design statement: 
The main problems with the current website are that items that should be emphasized (vaccination appointments, testing sites) aren't emphasized enough. In addition, there is too much information on the current site, as the current site is still an extension of the Arizona health website. Another issue is a lack of language flexibility, which is a necessity for this website to be a service to all citizens. In addition to upgrading the visual design, I hope that my project will also present solutions to the problem of overcrowding, assessibility, and information hierarchy.
### Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Firstly, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the Arizona main website and Covid-19 website in order to get a general feel for the website and to catch any immediate issues. I followed Nielson's 10 design heuristics in order to score the websites. [Learn More](https://github.com/jasonlai2/DH110-JasonLai/tree/main/Assignment01)

I then held a usability test on the Covid-19 site, designing tasks that I felt would illuminate possible insights and solutions to the issues based on the heuristic evaluation. My participant did indeed find issues with the current website. These discoveries and insights will be taken into account as I proceed with my assignment.

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
To hone in on the design issue, while also allowing for flexible solutions, I designed a contextual inquiry. I firstly had to figure out a target audience and specific tasks that they would undertake in order to solve relevant issues. I then formulated a research plan focused on the realistic experience of a users' context. I settled with having my participant undergo the task of scheduling a Covid-19 vaccination. The participant had pretty much no issue at all. I felt that the design problem may have been a bit too unrealistic, as the solution proved to be extremely accessible. Ultimately, the contextual inquiry could have been improved more, but nonetheless my participant provided valuable feedback about the discoverability of information.[Learn More](https://github.com/jasonlai2/DH110-JasonLai/tree/main/Assignment03)
### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
In order to better understand a user's point of view, as well as provide myself with concrete, direct issues to solve, I created two user personas as well as scenarios to pair with them. These allow me to take my design problem into a storytelling context, allowing for a start and end point to the design issues. In each of these scenarios, I made sure to design/improve a feature in order to solve whatever problems the persona had in their story. UX Storytelling has allowed me to better organize my thoughts in order to create plans for the next steps of my project.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment05 + part of 06]
Using figma, I created a low-fidelity prototype in order to capture two of my planned features: language changing and custom newsletter registrations. I decided on a more minimalistic menu layout to minimize the overcrowding of information that the original website had. In designing the interface, I chose colors that reflected the original essence of the website, while also making sure that no assessibility is compromised. I had a participant do an impression test in order to check if my website was instilling the intended message,

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)
I created an interactive, low-fidelity prototype so that I could examine how users would actually use my design solution. I decided on a more minimalistic menu layout to minimize the overcrowding of information that the original website had. The prototype is visually not very outstanding, as I focused on the interaction and flow. I had a participant test out my prototype, to which I recieved positive feedback.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Finally, I combined my layout design and low-fidelity prototype together in order to create my high-fidelity prototype. This prototype is the culmination of all of my research and designing, and so will serve as my answer to my initial design problems. I also ran a cognitive walkthough and to check if users understood the purpose of my prototype.

### Conclusion: 
Although this was not my first UX class, this was my first time doing an entire design challenge on my own. There were definitely nights and days where I was stressed and felt overwhelmed, but those moments are vital to my growth as a UX designer. I learned a lot about specific methodology, learned about the UX industry, and gained valuable experience. Thank you very much Professor Sookie for teaching this course. And thank you for watching this pitch video, I hope you have a great rest of your quarter.
