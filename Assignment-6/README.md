# Interface Design  
## DH110-Jason Lai
### Brief Description of Project
My project is a redesign of the Arizona Government's official Covid-19 website. I will apply UX fundamentals, including both heuristics, testing, and iterative processes, in order to design a solution that is both useful and enjoyable. The purpose of this interface design is to help me visualize certain variations of my wireframe, as well as implement visual upgrades to my previous wireframe. This assignment will result in an overall finalized theme for my website. Firstly, I picked a single wireframe from my previous assignment, and used it as a template. From that simple template, I created 3 different typographic variations. I then created 3 different button variations, experimenting with the button shapes and text format. Finally, I created two color variations, one light and one dark, and made sure these passed the color contrast test. Finally, I decided on a final design, polished it, and saved my typography, color, and grids as a design system.

### Finalized Design
In choosing my design, I decided on the font that would maximize both legibility and readability, and I decided on Sora. In addition, I created a new button: Contact, because I wanted to make sure that visitors had a way to get help if they needed. Based on user feedback, I created the About button as well as a subtitle under the title. I also created a search bar, to ensure that visitors don't have to dig through multiple pages to find what they are looking for. Finally, I rearranged my buttons based on size, and made them all uniform in size to maintain visual consistency. I also added some logos to the buttons to make things more clear.
