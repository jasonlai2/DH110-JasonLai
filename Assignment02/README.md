# UT Testing
##  DH110-JasonLai
### I will be conducting a Usability Test with the purpose of evaluating major heuristic flaws in the website: https://www.azdhs.gov/covid19/index.php from a users' perspective. The main heuristics that I will be checking in on will be Consistency and Standards, Visibility of System Status, and Match Between System and Real World. I have created three different tasks: one on researching Covid-19 guidelines within schools, one on researching data on Covid-19 cases based on county, and one on finding out how to get tested and vaccinated for Covid-19. These tests require the user to know where to look for the pages, understand common terms and interfaces from other websites, and seemlessly incorporate real-world representation to their browsing experience.

### In doing the UT test, I learned a couple of lessons. For one, I believe that it's okay to stay silent as the moderator, as trying to force yourself to talk may cause bias in the participant. It's also very important to have all your preparations ready so that the participant does not have to wait. Overall, I think that the UT went pretty well; my participant was able to clearly narrate their thought process, making the whole flow of work very followable. The participant illuminated a number of issues that I did not think about, such as the scroll sidebar being laggy, and additional paths to complete the tasks that I had prepared. In terms of what could be improved, I think that I could have done a better job wording the tasks, as well as making the questions on the survey more flexible. I also sometimes found myself giving biased direction and fumbling for words, which I think I will improve on with more UTs.

The intro script, informed consent, background questions, pre-test questions, post-test questions, and questions about confidential information were all given to me by the instructor, modified as needed to fit my task.
