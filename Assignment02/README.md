# UT Testing
##  DH110-JasonLai
### I will be conducting a Usability Test with the purpose of evaluating major heuristic flaws in the website: https://www.azdhs.gov/covid19/index.php from a users' perspective. The main heuristics that I will be checking in on will be Consistency and Standards, Visibility of System Status, and Match Between System and Real World. I have created three different tasks: one on researching Covid-19 guidelines within schools, one on researching data on Covid-19 cases based on county, and one on finding out how to get tested and vaccinated for Covid-19. These tests require the user to know where to look for the pages, understand common terms and interfaces from other websites, and seemlessly incorporate real-world representation to their browsing experience.
