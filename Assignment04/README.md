# Assignment 04: UX Storytelling
## DH110-Jason Lai

To me, UX Storytelling is about showcasing how a product actually fits into real life. Through a persona and scenario, a person is able to relate on a much more empathetic level to the product, as they can imagine themselves using the product as well vicariously through the persona. In my project, I want to showcase the ability for a design feature to make real impact on peoples' lives, and how the impact can spread like a shockwave.

### Features:
1. Summarization of media updates to make the information more digestable.(current media update videos are very long on the website)
2. Custom newsletter that people can sign up for and receive COVID-19 updates, in the language of their choice

## User Scenarios
### Jimmy 
Jimmy and his family have just immigrated to the states last year, and his parents don’t speak English very well. Jimmy has been working hard, and has gotten admitted as a computer science major at Arizona State University. Before heading to college, Jimmy wants to make sure his parents know how to take care of themselves in the COVID-19 pandemic without him around the house. Jimmy searches the internet for COVID-19 information, as well as appointments. A lot of links exist, but a lot of them do not have a language option for his family, and so he eventually finds Arizona’s Government Webpage. He clicks on the link, and the webpage greets him with a large “Welcome!” followed by a “Register” on the bottom. Jimmy clicks register, and inputs his phone number, email, and desired password. He clicks continue, and is taken to the homepage. He is surprised with how intuitive the home page is: there’s a clear section for scheduling appointments, a media section, a resources section, and a map with information on testing and vaccination sites. He checks out the media section, and sees a featured article on the front about COVID-19 in college. Intrigued, he continues to browse the media section, and likes how there’s a short summary at the beginning of the article. Going back to the homepage, he notices an icon on the top right that says ENG. He clicks it, and sees a huge number of languages that he can choose from; he even sees his family’s language! Satisfied, he clicks on his family’s language, and after a quick refresh, the homepage refreshes and is now loaded in his family’s language. He changes the language back to English, He clicks on the newsletter section and a new screen loads. On the screen, there are filters, allowing Jimmy to filter news by sources, as well as how frequently he would like to receive the news. Jimmy clicks on trustworthy news sources, and then clicks that he would like to receive weekly news messages. Satisfied with his experience, he tells his parents that he would like to register his parents on the website as well. He gets the needed information from his parents and registers with his parents’ email address and phone numbers. From there, he changes the language to his family’s language, and signs up for the newsletter as well. He tells his parents that he signed up for weekly emails, and that they will receive important updates on COVID-19 in their inbox. 
### Joanne
Joanne is browsing her computer for information on COVID-19, specifically so that she can transfer the information to children and their parents. She Googles “Government COVID-19 Page”, and clicks on the first link, Arizona COVID-19 Page. She clicks on the link, and the webpage greets him with a large “Welcome!” followed by a “Register” on the bottom. Joanne clicks register, and inputs her phone number, email, and desired password. After signing up, she is greeted with a homepage that has multiple sections: a media section, resources section, and appointment section with an interactive map. Joanne clicks on the media section, and finds a list of videos under a subtitle called “Media Updates.” Although these updates were all videos, Joanne finds a short paragraph to the right of each video, summarizing the key information. Joanne takes note of this, and goes back to the home page. She is curious about any relevant information for children, and then clicks on the Resources section. She is then taken to another page, with subsections for the Resources section. Subsections include “General,” “Elderly,” “Students,” and “Children.” Joanne clicks on the “Children” section, and is taken to another page. In this section, there are simplified presentations and activities designed to teach children about COVID-19. One of these activities, called “The Social Distancing Game,” was a game that centered around having kids 6 feet away from each other. With all of this new information in mind, Joanne creates an outline for her visit to the library. The next day, Joanne finishes her classes and heads straight to the library, greeting the librarian and heading to the second floor, where the afterschool program is. She gathers the children around and teaches them the Social Distancing Game that she got from the Arizona Government Website. The children love it, and some of them even continue playing it after Joanne calls for their attention. Joanne then explains the purpose behind the Social Distancing Game, transitioning to a presentation about COVID-19 and updates surrounding it. She presents this like a news lady, so that the children are entertained, but also paying attention to her.  As parents come to the library to pick their children up, Joanne encourages the parents to sign up for a custom newsletter that Joanne creates from the media updates on the Arizona Government Website. The parents thank Joanne, and sign up for the newsletter.
