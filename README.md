# Tentative Title: The Arizona Rewrite
##  DH110-JasonLai
### Description of Project: This project will feature a close examination of a current Arizona government website, and how it holds up under UX heuristics. From there, I will design alternative solutions that will hope to provide a solution to any violated heuristic, as well as enhance current strengths of the website. This will allow for a better user experience for anybody who needs to navigate Arizona's website.

### I will be reviewing each website using Jakob Nielson's 10 heuristics.
|10 Heuristics|Definitions|
|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|Whether you understand where you currently are on the webpage, and what steps to take to get closer to your goal|
|Match Between System and Real World|Whether there are clear signifiers and natural mappings to lessen confusion|
|User Control and Freedom|Allowing the user to undo their action and go back to a previous page|
|Consistency and Standards|Having conventional implementation of tools|
|Recognition Rather than Recall|Reduce the need for users to dig up info in their minds, rather have them recognize what's in front of them|
|Error Prevention|Preventing scenarios where error is even possible, providing warning messages|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|Allow for customization and shortcuts for existing tools so that users can more efficiently navigate|
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|Clean, simple design that isn't too cluttering|
|Helps User with Errors|Provide a responsive service that allows users to diagnose any encountered issues|
|Help and Documentation|Includes a manual or documentation page that allows users to search up and/or ask any questions they may have|

### These heuristics will be graded upon a scale from 1-3, with 1 indicating minor or no issue and 3 indicating major issue.

## Website 1: https://az.gov/

*Brief Description*: This website appears to be the main website for the Arizona government. It provides links that redirect visitors to pages that suit their specific needs. The website allows visitors to do a more comprehensive search using their search engine as well.

|Heuristic|Score|Explanation of Score and Solution if any|
|---|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|3|The main website seems to have the essentials. There is a large search box, seemingly the main purpose of this site, which is a good sign. In addition, there appears to be half flag, agency directory, service directory, employee login, and viewing option icons on the top right, which is quite difficult to even see. I would increase the visibility by making them larger and possibly changing the color of them. Also, there is a plus sign on the bottom right portion of the scene, which is confusingly an additional menu, bringing up the footer. I would just include the footer on the page at all times, and allow the user to scroll down.|
|Match Between System and Real World|1|Overall, no unclear definitions on the page. The homepage lists various divisions, all of which are easy to understand. There seem to be arrows on the sides of the center picture, which indicates that the user can scroll between different pictures.| 
|User Control and Freedom|2|Users have the ability to search for whatever they want on the Arizona government main page, but there seems to be a lack of advanced options for searching. Clicking the homepage logo is a reliable way to return to the main page.|
|Consistency and Standards|1|The website includes a traditional search engine. It also has a dropdown menu. Both of these are simple to understand and most likely encountered throughout other websites.|
|Recognition Rather than Recall|1|The website allows users to start with a general umbrella topic, and narrow their search down. Users do not need to recall agency nor service names.
|Error Prevention|1|There appears to be a lack of error prevention, however possible errors on this page seems to be quite minimal in the first place. Regardless, there are no warning messages at all, which may be helpful as a precaution for users if their search parameters don't return results.|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|2|There are no available shortcuts nor customizability on the webpage. A possible solution could be to
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|2|The colors are generally consistent. However, the center pictures take up quite a bit of space and may be distracting from the search engine aspect of this website. The slightly opaque pictures as a backdrop is not very pleasant, but fortunately there is an option to turn on high contrast, which turns the backdrop into a solid color.
|Helps User with Errors|2|There is no help at all if a search results returns nothing. A good way to alleviate this is to have an algorithm that asks if the user meant something else.
|Help and Documentation|2|There is a help section once the footer is expanded, and several services for requesting help. However, it appears that there lacks a designated message box, and instead only additional search engines. This may cause a problem to be answered with the exact same problem. On-demand chatting or a direct phone number would be the most useful for help.|

*Brief Description*: This website appears to be the Covid-19 information page for the state of Arizona. It includes their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as additional menu redirects to other pages about health.

|Heuristic|Score|Explanation of Score and Solution if any|
|---|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|2|The webpage has clear, readable menus on the top row. Users will most likely expect these menu pages to take them to where they want to be.|
|Match Between System and Real World|2|There is a familiar search bar magnifying glass, which users will quickly recognize is for searching. However, there is a somewhat hard-to-see menu icon on the left that follows the user as they scroll. It may be better to clarify that the menu on the side is not for different sections of the website, but to redirect users to different pages.| 
|User Control and Freedom|1|There exists a way to return to the Covid-19 mainpage, and it is through clicking on the logo on the top right, then clicking on the covid section. This makes sense as the Covid page isn't the main page and should redirect to the main page if the logo is clicked. In addition, it is not too difficult to return to the main Covid page|
|Consistency and Standards|3|The page looks modern, and has the necessities of an informatic hub. However, it is odd that the user has to click on a tiny dot to progress through the different mini-pages around the middle of the screen. In these mini-pages, it's not even intuitive that you could click on the links inside the mini-pages. It would help to have arrows or a horizontal scroll instead, as well as a different color for the clickable link. Also, in contrast to the main Arizona page, the expansion button on the bottom moves the user to the top of the page instead of expanding the footer.|
|Recognition Rather than Recall|1|Users do not really have to memorize anything to utilize this page.|
|Error Prevention|2|There are not any warning alerts on this page.|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|2|There is no form of shortcuts on this page. It may be helpful to allow users to choose which pages to save so that they may revisit it in the future.|
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|1|The website has clean, visible colors. There are aren't any misleading pictures or prompts that sacrificed clarity for decoration.|
|Helps User with Errors|2|Attempting to login to the vaccination portal with an incorrect email/password does not prompt a "reset your password" option. There is contact information at the bottom of the page|
|Help and Documentation|1|The website does a good job documenting different pages, as well as including a search engine to assist in looking up specific pages.|

This assignment was inspired by past students' heuristic evaluations. The Nielson Norman Group's 10 Heuristics served as a huge guide throughout this process.
