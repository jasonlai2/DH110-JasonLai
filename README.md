# Tentative Title: The Arizona Rewrite
##  DH110-JasonLai
### Description of Project: This project will feature a close examination of a current Arizona government website, and how it holds up under UX heuristics. From there, I will design alternative solutions that will hope to provide a solution to any violated heuristic, as well as enhance current strengths of the website. This will allow for a better user experience for anybody who needs to navigate Arizona's website.

### I will be reviewing each website using Jakob Nielson's 10 heuristics.
|10 Heuristics|Definitions|
|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|How easy it is to find what you need, and what your available options are.|
|Match Between System and Real World|Whether there are clear signifiers and natural mappings to lessen confusion|
|User Control and Freedom|Allowing the user to undo their action and go back to a previous page|
|Consistency and Standards|Having conventional implementation of tools|
|Recognition Rather than Recall|Reduce the need for users to dig up info in their minds, rather have them recognize what's in front of them|
|Error Prevention|Preventing scenarios where error is even possible, providing warning messages|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|Allow for customization and shortcuts for existing tools so that users can more efficiently navigate|
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|Clean, simple design that isn't too cluttering|
|Helps User with Errors|Provide a responsive service that allows users to diagnose any encountered issues|
|Help and Documentation|

### These heuristics will be graded upon a scale from 1-3, with 1 indicating minor or no issue and 3 indicating major issue.

## Website 1: https://az.gov/

*Brief Description*: This website appears to be the main website for the Arizona government. It provides links that redirect visitors to pages that suit their specific needs. The website allows visitors to do a more comprehensive search using their search engine as well.

|Heuristic|Score|Explanation of Score and Solution if any|
|---|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|3|The main website seems to have the essentials. There is a large search box, seemingly the main purpose of this site, which is a good sign. In addition, there appears to be half flag, agency directory, service directory, employee login, and viewing option icons on the top right, which is quite difficult to even see. I would increase the visibility by making them larger and possibly changing the color of them. Also, there is a plus sign on the bottom right portion of the scene, which is confusingly an additional menu, bringing up the footer. I would just include the footer on the page at all times, and allow the user to scroll down.|
|Match Between System and Real World|1|Overall, no unclear definitions on the page. The homepage lists various divisions, all of which are easy to understand. There seem to be arrows on the sides of the center picture, which indicates that the user can scroll between different pictures.| 
|User Control and Freedom|2|Users have the ability to search for whatever they want on the Arizona government main page, but there seems to be a lack of advanced options for searching. Clicking the homepage logo is a reliable way to return to the main page.|
|Consistency and Standards|1|The website includes a traditional search engine. It also has a dropdown menu. Both of these are simple to understand and most likely encountered throughout other websites.|
|Recognition Rather than Recall|1|The website allows users to start with a general umbrella topic, and narrow their search down. Users do not need to recall agency nor service names.
|Error Prevention|1|There appears to be a lack of error prevention, however possible errors on this page seems to be quite minimal in the first place. Regardless, there are no warning messages at all, which may be helpful as a precaution for users if their search parameters don't return results .|
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|2|There are no available shortcuts nor customizability on the webpage. A possible solution could be to
|Aesthetic and Minimalist Design|2|The colors are generally consistent. However, the center pictures take up quite a bit of space and may be distracting from the search engine aspect of this website. The slightly opaque pictures as a backdrop is not very pleasant, but fortunately there is an option to turn on high contrast, which turns the backdrop into a solid color.
|Helps User with Errors|2|There is no help at all if a search results returns nothing. A good way to alleviate this is to have an algorithm that asks if the user meant something else.
|Help and Documentation|2|There is a help section once the footer is expanded, and several services for requesting help. However, it appears that there lacks a designated message box, and instead only additional search engines. This may cause a problem to be answered with the exact same problem. On-demand chatting or a direct phone number would be the most useful for help.|
