# Contextual Inquiry
## Jason Lai DH110

### Design Challenge
*Main Research Goal*: 
From the students' perspective, I wanted to find a relevant and crucial task that's relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Making sure that one is vaccinated remains an extremely important part of student life right now, so I created the research question:
How might people have an easier time locating and scheduling a COVID-19 Vaccine appointment?

*Basic Need*: This task fulfils the user's basic need for safety and peace of mind. Knowing that there are vaccinations available will allow students to focus on their academics.

*Traditional/Current Solution*: Registering for an appointment online or finding drop-in locations.

*Limitations*: Possibly too many pages to click through, not knowing how long the wait time is, difficult-to-navigate digital map.\

### Target Users
Adolescent aged 18-22. Proficiency using an internet-accessing device(e.g. Computer, phone, tablet). Users will presumably be completing this activity while they are at their home/dorm, after or before classes. Users will most likely google the nearest vaccine center, and click on the links that guide them through the process.

### Research Method
Firstly, background questions will be asked in order to gain a better understanding of the user and the context that the user is in. 


I will then be providing the participant with a general task, with no limitations on the tools they may use(although it must be recordable over Zoom). The user will have complete freedom over their actions.

I will be overtly observing the participant throughout the task, asking clarifying questions throughout the task. I will also be encouraging the participant to narrate their thoughts and decision-making out loud.

After the task, I will ask some post-task questions in order to gain additional insight, as well as their reflective thoughts. I will ask the participant about pain points they encountered, possible improvements/solutions they may have, and overall satisfaction with their methods.

### Reflection
The most difficult part of this study was definitely designing a framework for the research question. I knew I had to choose a task that would be broad enough where the user's experience best reflects a realistic approach, yet confined enough such that the task would be insightful to my chosen website. In the end, I decided on a vaccination appointment as my task, but I do think that the task was a bit too short; I had a premonition that the inquiry during the task might be too redundant. But nonetheless, I couldn't come up with any better task, so I proceeded with this task. Designing the script was not too difficult, as essentially it was mostly questions that I prepared. I had a tiny bit of technical difficulties as I did not have screenshare permissions on right away, but that was quickly solved. I was actually pleasantly surprised wit some of the feedback I got from my participant, epecially during the post-task section. I learned that even for a simple task like searching for a vaccination appointment, certain design insights are still revealed, as when my participant talked about how he avoids looking at the top of google searched, or how he dislikes the cluttering of visuals for an essential service. The participant also reiterated the importance of credibility when searching for a service like this. All in all, this study surpassd my expectations, and I definitely have learned a lot about the importance of context for insight gathering.
