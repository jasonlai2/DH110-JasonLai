# Contextual Inquiry
## Jason Lai DH110

### Design Challenge
*Main Research Goal*: 
From the students' perspective, I wanted to find a relevant and crucial task that's relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Making sure that one is vaccinated remains an extremely important part of student life right now, so I created the research question:
How might people have an easier time locating and scheduling a COVID-19 Vaccine appointment?

*Basic Need*: This task fulfils the user's basic need for safety and peace of mind. Knowing that there are vaccinations available will allow students to focus on their academics.

*Traditional/Current Solution*: Registering for an appointment online or finding drop-in locations.

*Limitations*: Possibly too many pages to click through, not knowing how long the wait time is, difficult-to-navigate digital map.\

### Target Users
Adolescent aged 18-22. Proficiency using an internet-accessing device(e.g. Computer, phone, tablet). Users will presumably be completing this activity while they are at their home/dorm, after or before classes. Users will most likely google the nearest vaccine center, and click on the links that guide them through the process.

### Research Method
Firstly, background questions will be asked in order to gain a better understanding of the user and the context that the user is in. 


I will then be providing the participant with a general task, with no limitations on the tools they may use(although it must be recordable over Zoom). The user will have complete freedom over their actions.

I will be overtly observing the participant throughout the task, asking clarifying questions throughout the task. I will also be encouraging the participant to narrate their thoughts and decision-making out loud.

After the task, I will ask some post-task questions in order to gain additional insight, as well as their reflective thoughts. I will ask the participant about pain points they encountered, possible improvements/solutions they may have, and overall satisfaction with their methods.
