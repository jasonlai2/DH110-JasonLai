# Assignment 07: High Fidelity Prototype
## DH110 Jason Lai
### Assignment Description
My project is a redesign of the Arizona Government's Covid-19 information page. Through my past assignments, I decided to create a prototype that would allow users to go through user scenarios that I came up with. The purpose of this interactive prototype is to combine both website design and website interaction to create a relatively high-fidelity prototype that accurately captures aspects of the redesigned website. This was created on Figma, building on my prior assignments.

### Supported Tasks
My prototype supports two tasks:
1. Changing the site's language. Due to the large number of languages, I felt that prototyping only for one language was enough to understand the main issues.
2. Registering for a newsletter. I wanted to make the newsletter special in that the user could customize the frequency as well as sources that their news came from, in order to maximize user flexbility.

### Reflection
Overall, creating the prototype itself was quite fun, I enjoyed creating interaction sequences on Figma. I also tuned my visual design, based on feedback from my previous iterations. However, a cognitive walkthrough was a little more difficult than I imagined. I had two cognitive walkthroughs, the first one I messed up my dialogue so my participant was left a bit confused. For the second one(the one I have in this document), I also accidentally linked my participant to the wireframes instead of the prototype initially. Combined with the fact that I recruited the same people for studies, the actual research data may not be as accurate. However, I think I did the best with what data I had.
