# Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype
## DH110 Jason Lai
### Description of Project

This project is a redesign of the Arizona Government's COVID-19 website. Based on a heuristic evaluation, a usability test, and a contextual inquiry, I have identified key issues with the current design of the website, and I will create a redesign of the website that hopes to solve some of these issues. As the website is quite vast with information, the redesign will lack some information, but will still provide a framework for important aspects of the website.
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test if the flow of the website has the properties of good UX design. The prototype will be focusing mainly on interaction and flow, and so aesthetic visuals were not a priority.

### List of Supported Tasks
1) The prototype will allow user to change between languages. As there are many languages in the world, I only created an interaction for a single language for the purposes of this test.
2) The prototype will allow a user to sign up for a newsletter. The newsletter will feature customizability between the frequency of the newsletter as well as the sources from which the newsletter wll draw information from.

###  Prototype Images
The prototype was created entirely on Figma.

### Reflection
Overall, the testing went very smoothly. My participant had no issue completing all the tasks. The participant pointed out that the placement of the language button is good, so I will keep that in mind as I continue my project. During the registration task, my participant did not interact with any of the sources of frequency buttons, but that may be due to him assuming that he should not interact due to the intended lack of interaction on the personal information page. This may be solved in future tests by telling participants in advanced that the personal information page is the only page intended to not be interacted with.
